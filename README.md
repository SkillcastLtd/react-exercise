# Task
- Create a user registration form that takes in the following fields:
  - First name
  - Last name
  - Email Address
  - Date of birth

- The form must validate with the following rules;
  - All fields are required
  - First and last names must be alphanumeric
  - Email address must be a valid email format
  - User must be 18 years or older.

- On form submit:
  - give feedback to the user
    - if there are validation errors, show them.
    - if there are no validation errors:
      - the data must be displayed in a table below
      - the form must be reset.

- Each successful form submission should be stored and displayed, but we should also be able to clear/delete an individual submission as well as clear/delete them all.

- You may, and are encouraged to, use whatever libraries you can justify using. 
This includes UI libraries like Bootstrap, Material UI etc.
